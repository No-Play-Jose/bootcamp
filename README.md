UWS Games Design Task

This whole task shall be completed and to be submitted by Friday 29th November 2019 (week 13) 4pm on Moodle.

All submissions must be made through Moodle. All files must be named as follows: 

For team submissions, include the team name: e.g. CGD_TeamName_Design_Document.dox

Where multiple files are being submitted use an archive utility like 7-Zip to compress them into a single zip file, 
which you should name as above. This also applies to the submission of your working prototype. 
Working prototype of the game (check file size – if file is too big you may have to submit via a USB or 
share the link to the game via Google Drive, GitHub or Dropbox). If anything is password protected you must inform the 
lecturer of the password.

Video of the game – a minimum of five minutes should suffice (i.e. long enough to illustrate the salient features 
of the game in relation to the overall design process).
